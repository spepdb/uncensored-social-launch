            <p class="section-body">
              Most social platforms are optimized for ad revenue, not people. Your data is tracked,
              your feed is manipulated, and what you see is filtered by opaque rules you never voted on.
            </p>
            <p class="section-body">
              Uncensored Social is a small, independent project funded directly by the people who
              want it to exist. The goal is simple: build a place where speech and privacy matter
              more than ad targeting and engagement hacks.

          The first version of Uncensored Social focuses on core features that put control back

              Messaging is being built with end-to-end encryption in mind from the beginning,
              instead of bolted on later as a marketing feature.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-q">Is this actually going to launch?</h3>
          <p class="faq-a">
            That’s the goal. The whole point of this page is to gather people who want
            it to exist, and to fund the work needed to get it to a stable, public release.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-q">Will it be free to use?</h3>
          <p class="faq-a">
            Yes. The intention is for the core platform to be free for regular users.
            Donations help make that sustainable and reduce pressure for ads or data-selling.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-q">How are email and phone numbers used?</h3>
          <p class="faq-a">
            Only to contact you about launch, major updates, and possibly early access invites.
            No spam. No selling lists to anyone. You can opt out later if you change your mind.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-q">What kind of content will be removed?</h3>
          <p class="faq-a">
            The focus is on blocking obvious spam, bots, and clearly illegal content.
            The goal is not to remove posts just because they’re controversial or
            outside of mainstream opinions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-q">Will there be a mobile app?</h3>
          <p class="faq-a">
            That’s a major goal. Part of why donations matter is to make it possible to
            build native Android and iOS apps after the web version is stable.
